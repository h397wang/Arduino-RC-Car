# Arduino-RC-Car

#Design
Uses a remote controller Arduino library to facilitate the reading of IR signals.
Each button on the remote controller corresponds to some basic function for the car: accelerate, deaccelerate, stop etc.

#Results
Unidentical wheels have different frictions and torque causing a constant veer.
This can be nullified by biasing the analog signals to the dc motors

#Hindsight
Pretty much what I expected from using cheap china made parts.
A joy stick controller would probably be more appropriate.
